# VRKeys - A VR keyboard for use with NewtonVR

VRKeys is a simple keyboard interface for single-line text input that integrates with [NewtonVR](https://github.com/TomorrowTodayLabs/NewtonVR).

It also uses the [Oculus Audio SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-audio-sdk-plugins/) for spatialization of audio produced when you press a key, but this is easily replaceable too (just remove the `ONSP Audio Source` component from the Sphere under `LeftMallet` and `RightMallet`).
