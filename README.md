VRKeys is a simple keyboard interface for single-line text input that integrates with [NewtonVR](https://github.com/TomorrowTodayLabs/NewtonVR).

Requirements:

* [NewtonVR](https://github.com/TomorrowTodayLabs/NewtonVR)
* [TextMesh Pro](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84126)
* [Oculus Audio SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-audio-sdk-plugins/)

> To replace the Oculus Audio SDK with an alternate spatializer, just remove `ONSP AudioSource` from the Sphere object under `LeftMallet` and `RightMallet`.
